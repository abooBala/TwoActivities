# TwoActivities
Navigate between two screens in Android Studio (Codelabs for Android Developer Fundamentals)

In this project, we navigate between two screens. It is a simple example to fully undersand how activities, intents (explicit in this case), and intent extras work. 
A user can type a message and send to the second screen. 
The second user can respond to this message and send data back to the preevious activity with an intent extra.
